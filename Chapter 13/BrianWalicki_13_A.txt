---

Logical Steps:  
1. Import libraries
2. Initialize list and database
3. Define available cities
4. Loop through 'cities' dictionary and create a list of dictionaries in 'population'
5. Define 'sim_growth(city)'
6. Simulate the growth of each city 20 times
7. Generate database of all cities population's over the 20 years
8. Ask user for input
9. Plot user's chosen city using 'plot_growth(city)'
